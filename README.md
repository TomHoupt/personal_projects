level_v2.py is a program that 'gamifies' you working towards a goal. You need to track the number of minutes you worked on a task and then input that. It will tell you what level you are based on that. 
Each new level 10% more (rounded up) than the level before it
Right now it is not tied to a database so you will need to enter total minutes each time, not minutes since you last enter an input
I did most of this but GPT4.0 did help clean it up at the end
